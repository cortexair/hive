## Coding Session - 12:00 AM

Added log streaming feature to hive:
- `--follow` / `-F` flag for real-time log streaming
- New `logsFollow()` method in Hive class
- Uses `docker logs -f` under the hood
- Graceful exit on SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
- 3 new tests added (163 total now passing)
- Version bumped to 0.5.1
- Commit 2871075, pushed to GitHub

Example usage:
```bash
hive logs worker-1 -F  # Follow mode
hive logs worker-1 --follow
```

Note: Used `-F` (uppercase) for follow to avoid conflict with existing `-f` (file) flag used for spawn.
