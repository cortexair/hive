## Coding Session - 6:00 PM

Added resource limit features to hive:
- `--memory` flag for memory limits (e.g., `--memory 512m`, `--memory 2g`)
- `--cpus` flag for CPU limits (e.g., `--cpus 0.5`, `--cpus 2`)
- Resource limits stored in minion metadata
- 4 new tests added (160 total now passing)
- Version bumped to 0.4.2
- Pushed to GitHub

Example usage:
```bash
hive spawn worker-1 -f task.md --memory 1g --cpus 1
```

Note: Claude Code was unusually slow today - spent 10+ minutes "thinking" without producing any changes. Had to kill it and implement manually.
